## A very irritating programming language, named after [a very irritating word to pronounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_sauce).

#### Guide can be found in [GRAMMAR.md](GRAMMAR.md).

## About
Worcester-Lang (WCL) is an [esoteric language (esolang)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Our language aims to alienate users familiar with other languages, with unusual and redundant syntax, as well as a not-so-healthy dose of pseudo-random bullshit that decides your program's fate.

## Your arch nemesis
Enter **Worcest**, our mascot and your enemy throughout your experience using this language. His goal is to insult you, sabotage you, and *literally* make you beg for him not to fuck up your program as it runs.

## More
Some pre-written scripts demonstrating the language can be found in `worcester-lang/experiments`.
